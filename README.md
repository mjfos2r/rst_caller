# RST Caller
Written by Michael J. Foster for the Lemieux Lab @ Massachusetts General Hospital.

This is an experimental tool for the RST classification of *B. burgdorferi* genomes.
It requires [seqkit](https://github.com/shenwei356/seqkit) to perform in silico PCR.

It should not be considered functional or accurate until otherwise specified.
